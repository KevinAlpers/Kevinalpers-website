        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a person that has an interest in many things. I enjoy sports, such as football and basketball. It is fun to be able to
        go outside and play these sports with my family and friends. Some hobbies I enjoy doing include swimming and working out. In the Summer, it
        gets very hot, especially in Riverside, which makes swimming very relaxing. Working out is something I do to stay in shape and be healthy. Other 
        things I like to do are collecting shoes and playing video games on my downtime. I am a huge sneakerhead, and I love collecting Retro Jordans. I 
        almost have all of the retro Jordans you can think of. I also love to play video games with my friends. I am a fun and likable person that is 
        easy to talk to. I like to have conversations with my co-workers and friends about a lot of things that don't relate to the activities listed above
        too, such as talking about stocks and investments. Stocks and investmenets interest me as it shows me where the economy is heading and what new
        technology is in demand.<br><br>

        I have worked a variety of jobs throughout my life so far. The first place I ever got a job at was Wendy's. I was in the fast food industry for a
        while. I ended up quitting that job, and I started working at Panda Express. While I was working at these fast food restaurants, I would always 
        help the customers with their needs, and I was able to multitask with things that had to be done at the restaurant. Eventually, I got tired of the 
        fast food restaurant, and I started working at Amazon. They paid me better, and I was able to get more hours. I would work at a station packaging 
        boxes. I would have to work very fast and efficiently to keep up the pace. After I finished working at Amazon, I finally decided to pursue a job 
        that involved my degree. I started to work at an accounting firm known as Deloitte, where I would prepare financial statements for companies and
        complete their taxes. I worked there for about two years learning a lot from my peers and mentors. <br><br>

        My education all started at the University of California, Riverside where I majored in business and concentrated in accounting. I would be an 
        excellent student and I had a 4.0 GPA when I graduated. I minored in computer science where it helped me hone my ability to use a computer well. I 
        would graduate a summa cum laude and finished in three years. I eventually decided to take the Certified Public Accountant Exam and pass with 
        flying colors. After finding a job with my CPA license, I decided to go back to school at the University of Southern California, where I went to 
        pursue my MBA in accounting. It was very rigorous, but eventually, I finished it and I got my MBA. I have a variety of work experience working in 
        the field and interacting with other people. If you are interested in hiring me, feel free to contact me through the following links.
